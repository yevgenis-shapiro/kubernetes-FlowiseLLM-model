## Generative AI | Agents and LLM workflows 
Flowise is an open-source, no-code / low-code tool for visually building LLM-based applications — like chatbots, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, agents, and pipelines — using a drag-and-drop interface similar to Node-RED or n8n.


🧩  Key Features
```
✅ Visual Builder - Create LLM workflows by connecting blocks (LLM, Prompt, Tools, Database, etc.) in a flow editor
✅ Powered by LangChain - Every node corresponds to a LangChain component — so you can easily export and run it as code later.
✅ Supports many models:
OpenAI (GPT-3.5 / GPT-4)
Anthropic Claude
Google Gemini
Mistral, Ollama (local models)
Hugging Face models
And through LiteLLM — virtually any model you want!
✅ RAG & vector stores - Integrates with Pinecone, FAISS, Chroma, Weaviate, Supabase, and more for retrieval-based chat.
✅ Agents & Tools - Add nodes for Google Search, API calls, calculators, or your own custom Python functions
✅ API endpoints - Each flow can be deployed as a REST API endpoint, so your app or frontend can use it directly.
✅ Authentication, caching, and data logging included.
