## Generative AI | Agents and LLM workflows 🚀🚀🚀
Flowise is an open-source, no-code / low-code tool for visually building LLM-based applications — like chatbots, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, agents, and pipelines — using a drag-and-drop interface similar to Node-RED or n8n.


🧱  Key Features
```
✅ Visual Builder - Create LLM workflows by connecting blocks (LLM, Prompt, Tools, Database, etc.) in a flow editor
✅ Powered by LangChain - Every node corresponds to a LangChain component — so you can easily export and run it as code later.
✅ Supports many models:
OpenAI (GPT-3.5 / GPT-4)
Anthropic Claude
Google Gemini
Mistral, Ollama (local models)
Hugging Face models
And through LiteLLM — virtually any model you want!

✅ Human in the Loop
✅ API, CLI, SDK, Embedded Chatbot
✅ Teams & Workspaces
